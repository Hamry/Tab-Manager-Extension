# Tab-Manager-Extension

## Purpose

A browser extension which automatically closes tabs based on certain rules(default is to keep last 10 tabs used)

## Background

I am a huge tab hoarder and it gets so bad that my laptop suffers. Whats worse is that I leave a tab open to come back to it, but when a window gets too messy I just make a new one and I end up with hundreds of tabs across multiple windows.

I made this extension to keep my windows compact and it works under the assumptions that I'm probably not actively using more than 10 tabs at once and that I can probably recover more tabs.

## Whats Next

I think I'll add hotkeys for recovering tabs or some kind of history feature when an important tab gets closed.
